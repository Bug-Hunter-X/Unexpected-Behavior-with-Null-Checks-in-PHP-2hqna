# PHP Null Check Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP related to null checks and loose typing. The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version.

The core issue lies in how PHP handles null values and comparisons. The solution employs strict comparison (`===`) to ensure accurate null checks and avoid undefined index notices.
